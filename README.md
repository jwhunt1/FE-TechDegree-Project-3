# Front End TechDegree Project 3
 In the third project of my Front End TechDegree with Treehouse, I was tasked with recreating designs provided to me with mock up images of a coding newsletter at 320px and 768px. My goal was to recreate these in a mobile first approach, building up from 320px to match the mock up designs of each size through media queries. 
 
This project was created using HTML & CSS, built in VS Code, and tested in Chrome Version 78.0.3904.108
